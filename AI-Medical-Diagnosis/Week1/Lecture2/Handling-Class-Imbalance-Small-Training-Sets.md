# Generating More Samples

This section introduces a second solution to the dataset size challenge in medical image classification, focusing on the concept of data augmentation. The key points covered include:

- **Tricking the Network with Data Augmentation:**
   - The strategy is to give the network the impression of having more training examples by applying transformations to the images just before passing them into the network.
   - Examples of transformations include rotation, translation, zooming, changing brightness or contrast, or a combination of these.

- **Data Augmentation Methodology:**
   - The practice is termed "data augmentation."
   - The choice of transformations is driven by two key questions:
      - Whether the transformation reflects variations that aid the model in generalizing to the test set and real-world scenarios.
      - Whether the transformation preserves the label of the image, ensuring that the network learns to recognize variations while maintaining the same label.

- **Transformation Design Choices:**
   - Design choices are influenced by the belief that selected transformations represent real-world variations.
   - Caution in selecting transformations that do not alter the label, ensuring the network recognizes images with variations while maintaining the same label.
