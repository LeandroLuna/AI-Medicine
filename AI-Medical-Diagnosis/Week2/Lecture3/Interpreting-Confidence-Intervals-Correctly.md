# Sampling from the Total Population

1. **Total Population vs. Sampling:**
   - The goal is to evaluate the accuracy of a chest x-ray model on a total population of 50,000 patients.
   - In reality, testing the model on the entire population is impractical.

2. **Population Accuracy (p):**
   - If the model could be tested on all 50,000 patients, the resulting accuracy is referred to as the population accuracy (p), denoted as small p.
   - For instance, if the accuracy on the entire population is found to be 0.78, it is the population accuracy.

3. **Unknown Population Accuracy:**
   - In practice, the population accuracy (p) remains unknown since testing the model on the entire population is infeasible.

4. **Sampling Approach:**
   - To estimate the population accuracy, a sample of a hundred patients is taken from the hospital.
   - The accuracy on this sample is found to be 0.8.

5. **Confidence Intervals:**
   - The question arises: Can we infer anything about the range in which the population accuracy (p) is likely to fall based on this sample?
   - Confidence intervals are introduced to address this question.
   - Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which we can reasonably expect the true population parameter to lie.

# Confidence Intervals

1. **Definition of Confidence Intervals:**
   - Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which a population parameter is estimated to lie.
   - In the example, it is mentioned that, based on a sample, the 95 percent confidence interval for the population accuracy (p) is from 0.72 to 0.88.

2. **Interpretation of Confidence Intervals:**
   - The interval has two values: 0.72 (lower bound) and 0.88 (upper bound).
   - The interpretation is that there is a 95 percent confidence that the true population accuracy lies within this interval.

3. **Understanding 95 Percent Confidence:**
   - The statement "95 percent confident" doesn't mean there is a 95 percent probability that the population parameter is within the interval.
   - It also doesn't imply that 95 percent of the sample accuracies lie within this interval.

4. **Nuanced Interpretation:**
   - The nuanced interpretation requires thinking about making repeated samples.
   - If we were to repeatedly sample 100 patients from the population, calculate sample accuracies, and construct confidence intervals, we would obtain a distribution of intervals.
   - The key insight is that in about 95 percent of such samples, the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true population accuracy.

5. **Confidence Level:**
   - The term "95 percent" refers to the confidence level.
   - In repeated sampling, this method is expected to produce intervals that include the population parameter in about 95 percent of samples.

# 95% Confidence Interval

Instead of computing confidence intervals for multiple samples, practitioners typically assess model performance on a single sample. The computed confidence interval for this sample may or may not contain the true population parameter (p), but there is a 95% confidence that it does. The width of confidence intervals is influenced by factors such as sample size. A larger sample size results in a more accurate estimate of population accuracy, as evidenced by narrower confidence intervals. This is demonstrated by comparing two samples, one with 500 patients (larger) and another with fewer patients. Despite both samples having a model accuracy of 0.8, the confidence intervals are tighter for the larger sample and wider for the smaller one. In summary, confidence intervals are valuable for expressing the range within which population accuracy is likely to lie based on results obtained from a sample, providing insight when evaluating models on populations is impractical.
