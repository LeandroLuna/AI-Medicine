# Absolute Risk Reduction

In this lesson on "Absolute Risk Reduction," the instructor covers machine-learning techniques for predicting the impact of a treatment on individual patients. The focus is on understanding the causal effect of a treatment on a population through the setup of randomized control trials. The example given involves a doctor testing a new treatment for reducing heart attacks. The patients are divided into a treatment arm (receives the new treatment) and a control arm (does not receive the treatment or receives a placebo/standard care). After a year of observation, the absolute risk of heart attacks is calculated for each group (2% in the treatment group and 5% in the control group). The absolute risk reduction is then determined by subtracting the absolute risk in the treatment group from that in the control group (0.05 - 0.02 = 0.03). This value represents the reduction in absolute risk attributed to the treatment.

# Randomized Control Trials

In this lecture on Randomized Control Trials (RCTs), the discussion revolves around evaluating the effectiveness of a medical treatment. The doctor expresses concern about potential bias in patient assignment to treatment and control groups, emphasizing the importance of comparable groups for accurate results. The speaker reassures the doctor, explaining that random assignment was employed to ensure similarity between the groups.

The concept of a randomized control trial (RCT) is introduced, defined as a medical experiment where subjects are randomly allocated to different treatment groups for comparison. The doctor appreciates the random assignment process but questions whether the observed treatment effect (absolute risk reduction of 0.03) could be due to chance.

The speaker introduces the concept of p-values to assess statistical significance. A p-value smaller than 0.001 indicates a less than 0.1% probability of observing the observed difference if the treatment has zero effect. This low p-value leads to the conclusion of statistical significance.

The discussion then shifts to the number needed to treat (NNT), a measure of treatment effect. The NNT is explained as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (1/0.03), resulting in 33.3. This means that, on average, 33.3 people need to receive the treatment to prevent one heart attack.

Overall, the lecture emphasizes the importance of randomization in RCTs, introduces statistical significance through p-values, and explains the practical interpretation of treatment effect using the number needed to treat (NNT).
