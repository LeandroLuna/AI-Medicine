# Medical Prognosis

In this lesson on "Medical Prognosis," the instructor begins by defining prognosis as the medical practice of predicting the risk of future events, which can include outcomes like death, heart attacks, or strokes for individuals with specific medical conditions or the general population. Prognosis is crucial in medical practice for several reasons:

- **Informing Risk of Developing Illness:** Prognosis helps inform individuals about their risk of developing a particular illness. For example, certain blood tests estimate the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.

- **Estimating Survival Time:** Prognosis informs patients about how long they can expect to survive with a specific illness. Cancer staging, for instance, provides an estimate of survival time for patients with a particular cancer.

- **Guiding Treatment:** Prognosis plays a role in guiding treatment decisions. For instance, predicting the 10-year risk of a heart attack helps determine whether a patient should receive drugs to reduce the risk. Similarly, the six-month mortality risk is used for determining end-of-life care for patients with advanced and incurable conditions.

The lesson engages participants by presenting scenarios and asking them to determine whether each is a prognostic task:

- **Estimating 10-Year Cardiovascular Risk:** This is identified as a prognostic task because it involves predicting the future risk of a cardiovascular event.

- **Using a Chest CT Scan for Lung Cancer Diagnosis:** This is not a prognostic task as it involves the identification (diagnosis) of an illness, not the prediction of a future event.

- **Recommending Lifestyle Changes to a Patient:** This is considered a treatment recommendation, not a prediction of future risk, and thus not a prognostic task.

- **Forecasting the Risk of Lung Cancer Recurrence:** This is recognized as a prognostic task because it involves predicting the future risk of a specific event, in this case, the recurrence of lung cancer.
