# Course 2 Intro with Andrew and Pranav

The second course in the medical specialization focuses on medical prognosis, specifically the prediction of future health outcomes for patients. Prognosis involves estimating risks such as the likelihood of a heart attack or the risk of mortality over a certain period. The course covers the use of machine learning, particularly decision trees and random forests, to analyze structured medical data and make accurate predictions about patients' future health.

In the first week, participants learn about the concept of prognosis and explore various examples of prognostic tasks, some of which are routine in clinical practice. The second week delves into building machine learning models with decision trees to model nonlinear relationships observed in medical data, particularly in predicting mortality.

Handling missing data in machine learning models is a key challenge addressed in practice, and participants learn different strategies for managing missing data in their pipelines during this course. In the third week, the focus shifts to survival models, which are employed when estimating the probability of a patient surviving a specific duration after a medical event, such as cancer diagnosis. Survival models also help predict the likelihood of disease recurrence after treatment.

The fourth week covers strategies for building and evaluating survival models, introducing two specific models: the Cox proportional-hazards model and survival trees. Participants also learn methods to compare risks among individual patients and evaluate the performance of the survival prediction models they build.

The course concludes by emphasizing the growing importance of machine learning in analyzing large medical datasets to uncover complex relationships and answer critical questions about patient outcomes, such as the factors influencing survival rates and the long-term risk of specific health events.
