# Individualized Predictions

The lesson on "Individualized Predictions" introduces the Cox Proportional Hazards Model, emphasizing its capability to incorporate patient variables for a personalized assessment of risk. The Cox Model is discussed in the context of population-based survival models, where a single hazard function is applied to all patients within a population. However, the challenge arises when patients exhibit diverse characteristics that may influence their individual risks, such as age and smoking status.

To address this challenge, the lesson proposes a method for modeling the hazard for an individual patient. The hazard for an individual at any time \(t\) is expressed as the baseline hazard at time \(t\) (represented by \(\lambda_0\)) multiplied by a multiplicative factor. This factor is determined by the patient's variables, such as smoking status and age. The lesson illustrates this concept with an example, showing a baseline hazard curve for the population and how it is multiplied by a specific factor (e.g., 1.35) based on the individual's characteristics.

The goal is to create an individualized hazard function (\(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots\)) that reflects the unique risk profile of each patient, considering factors like age and smoking habits. This approach allows for a more nuanced and personalized assessment of survival risk, acknowledging the diversity among patients in the population.

# Relative Risk

The lecture on "Relative Risk" introduces a hazard model similar to a linear model but with an exponentiation step. The model is used to calculate the relative risks of patients based on their characteristics. The key point is to understand that the exponentiation ensures the output is always greater than or equal to zero. The baseline hazard (\( \lambda_0 \)) is multiplied by factors determined by the patients' characteristics.

The example involves comparing the relative risks of two patients, patient one and patient two, based on their age and smoking status. Patient one, a 50-year-old smoker, has a hazard calculated as \(\lambda_0 \times \exp(0.08 + 0.01 \times 50)\), resulting in a factor of 1.79. On the other hand, patient two, a 30-year-old non-smoker, has a hazard calculated as \(\lambda_0 \times \exp(0.08 + 0.01 \times 30)\), resulting in a factor of 1.35.

In summary, the relative risks for patient one and patient two are determined by multiplying the baseline hazard (\( \lambda_0 \)) by specific factors (1.79 and 1.35, respectively) based on their characteristics.

# Ranking Patients by Risk

The lecture on "Ranking Patients by Risk" focuses on comparing the risks of different patients based on their hazard values. The hazard for each patient is represented in terms of the baseline hazard. Patient one's hazard is the baseline hazard times 1.79, while patient two's hazard is the baseline hazard times 1.35. Since the hazard is always non-negative, the higher factor for patient one indicates that patient one consistently has at least as much risk as patient two, if not higher, at all time points.

To compute the hazard for a new patient (patient three), the speaker illustrates the calculation using the patient's characteristics, such as age and smoking status. The hazard for patient three is determined as the product of the baseline hazard and a factor based on the patient's attributes.

After computing the hazards for all three patients, a risk comparison is made. The lecture emphasizes that the factor associated with a 50-year-old smoker is the highest, followed by the 50-year-old non-smoker and then the 30-year-old non-smoker. This information allows for the creation of a risk ranking, indicating that patient one has a higher risk than patient two, who, in turn, has a higher risk than patient three. The lecture underscores the importance of hazard values in assessing and ranking the risk levels of individual patients.

# Individual vs Baseline Hazard

The lecture on "Individual vs Baseline Hazard" delves into the proportional hazards model, where the hazard is expressed as the baseline hazard multiplied by a factor determined by patient covariates. The focus is on understanding the impact of patient covariates on the hazard.

The speaker demonstrates that when all covariates are zero, the hazard for a patient equals the baseline hazard. Mathematically, this is illustrated as the expression evaluating to 1. This scenario helps conceptualize the baseline hazard when patient covariates contribute a factor of one.

The flexibility of the model is emphasized, as the baseline hazard is not explicitly specified and can take any shape. Two graphs are presented to illustrate different baseline hazards. In one case, a constant baseline hazard is depicted, and on the left, a patient with a risk factor of 1.35 is shown to consistently affect the hazard. On the right, a bathtub curve hazard is shown, where the baseline hazard varies, and the patient hazard remains 1.35 times the risk at each time point.

The lecture highlights how the proportional hazards model allows for the incorporation of patient covariates to modify the baseline hazard, offering versatility in capturing different hazard patterns.

# Smoker vs Non-smoker

The lecture titled "Smoker vs Non-smoker" focuses on comparing the hazard rates between smokers and non-smokers. The speaker begins by calculating the hazard for a smoker (\(\lambda_{\text{smoker}}\)) using the baseline hazard (\(\lambda_0\)) and specific coefficients. The hazard for a non-smoker (\(\lambda_{\text{non-smoker}}\)) is similarly computed.

To determine the relative risk between a smoker and a non-smoker, the speaker calculates the ratio of their hazards (\(\frac{\lambda_{\text{smoker}}}{\lambda_{\text{non-smoker}}}\)). Notably, the age is left unspecified in the calculations, allowing for a general comparison. The key simplifications in the ratio involve canceling out common terms, resulting in a simplified expression.

The final ratio is expressed as the exponent of \(0.08\), simplifying to \(1.08\). Importantly, this ratio is obtained without making any assumptions about age or baseline terms, as these cancel out during the calculations. The lecture provides a method to quantify and compare the risk of smokers to non-smokers based on hazard rates.

# Effect of Age on Hazard

The lecture on the "Effect of Age on Hazard" discusses the application of a similar principle used for the smoker variable to analyze the impact of age on risk. Unlike the binary nature of smoking (taking values of zero or one), age is a continuous variable. The focus is on comparing the risk of being a specific age to that of being a different age.

The speaker introduces the hazard rates, denoted as \(\lambda\), for ages 51 and 50. The hazard rate for age 51, \(\lambda_{51}(t)\), is expressed as a function of the baseline hazard rate (\(\lambda_0\)), an exponent term (0.08), and an age-specific coefficient (0.01 times 51). Similarly, the hazard rate for age 50, \(\lambda_{50}(t)\), includes the smoking status with an unspecified coefficient, the baseline hazard rate, and an age-specific coefficient (0.01 times 50).

The ratio \(\frac{\lambda_{51}(t)}{\lambda_{50}(t)}\) is then derived, and after simplification, the terms involving the baseline hazard rate and smoking status cancel out. The final result is expressed as an exponent with the difference between age-specific coefficients: \(0.01 \times 51 - 0.01 \times 50\). This simplifies to \(0.01\) times \(\text{exp}(0.01)\), where \(\text{exp}(0.01)\) is approximately \(1.01\).

In conclusion, the risk ratio of a 51-year-old compared to a 50-year-old is approximately \(1.01\), indicating a slight increase in risk associated with age.

# Risk Factor Increase Per Unit Increase in a Variable

The lecture on "Risk Factor Increase Per Unit Increase in a Variable" discusses the interpretation of hazard ratios and risk factors in the context of different variables such as smoking status and age. The speaker highlights the following key points:

- **Smoking Status:**
   - The hazard ratio for a smoker compared to a non-smoker is 1.08.
   - The risk for a smoker is 1.08 times the risk for a non-smoker.
   - The exponent of the weight (0.08) associated with the smoking variable represents the risk factor increase for a unit increase in the smoking variable (e.g., going from 0 to 1).

- **Age:**
   - The hazard for a 51-year-old compared to a 50-year-old is 1.01.
   - The risk for a 51-year-old is 1.01 times the risk for a 50-year-old.
   - The exponent of the weight (0.01) associated with the age variable represents the risk factor increase for a unit increase in the age variable (e.g., going from 50 to 51).
   - The concept applies to any unit increase in the age variable, such as going from 40 to 41 or from 42 to 43.

The speaker emphasizes that the exponential function of the weight provides a way to quantify the risk factor increase for a unit increase in a given variable. This understanding is crucial for interpreting hazard ratios and assessing the impact of different variables on the risk of an event.

# Risk Factor Increase or Decrease

The lecture titled "Risk Factor Increase or Decrease" discusses the Cox Proportional Hazards Model and its application to patient variables, such as age, smoking status, HDL cholesterol, and treatment. The model involves assigning weights (betas) to each variable, and the general expression for the hazard function (\(\lambda(t)\)) is presented as \(\lambda_0(t) \times \exp(\beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots)\), where \(X_i\) represents the variables.

The key points covered in the lecture include:

- **Factor Risk Increase:**
   - The lecture introduces the concept of factor risk increase associated with a unit increase in a variable (\(X_i\)).
   - The weight (\(\beta_i\)) associated with each variable determines the factor risk increase when the variable increases by one unit.
   - Examples with age and smoking are discussed, where an increase in age or smoking status leads to a factor risk increase (e.g., 1.08 for smoking).

- **Factor Risk Decrease:**
   - The lecture highlights that when the exponent of the weight (\(\exp(\beta_i)\)) is smaller than 1, it indicates a factor risk decrease.
   - Examples with HDL cholesterol and treatment are provided, demonstrating that higher HDL and receiving treatment are associated with reduced risk (factor less than 1).

- **Application to Patient Variables:**
   - An example involving four patient variables (age, HDL cholesterol, treatment, and smoking) is presented.
   - The weights associated with each variable are used to calculate the factor risk increase or decrease.
   - The interpretation is illustrated, emphasizing how each variable contributes to the overall risk for a patient.

Overall, the lecture provides a practical understanding of how the Cox Proportional Hazards Model quantifies the impact of different variables on the risk of an event, distinguishing between factors that increase or decrease the risk for individuals.
